# FiniteStateMachine_Merger
This is a Finite State Machine Merger. The program merges virtual machines and takes the Union, Intersection, and Substraction of the Accepting States of both machines

#############################
# Must-Knows & Pre-reqs
These are things you must know to understand the program:
1. Understand what a Finite State Machine is and how it functions.
2. Have a basic understanding of the merging process for Finite State Machines.
3. Have a basic knowledge of set operaitons.

#############################
# To Run the program:
1. Download the repository in a machine with Python installed.
2. Run the script from the command line using "python \<name of the program\>"
3. Pass in the proper arguments as listed below
4. Make sure the Merge.py file is in the same directory as the file Minimize.py. Merge.py includes and calls functions from Minimize.py. If both files are not in the same directory, the program will not run.

#############################
# Arguments - Minimizer.py receives 3 command line arguments in the following order:
# A Definition File

The Definition File configures the machine following the instructions in the Description file (description.pdf).
# The output FSA file name

The program creates an FSA definition file following the instructions in the Descrption file (description.pdf). The name of the file created is the name passed in as this argument.
# A record file name

The scripts creates a record/log file where it writes down all the modifications it does to the machine. The name of the record file is the name passed in as this argument.
